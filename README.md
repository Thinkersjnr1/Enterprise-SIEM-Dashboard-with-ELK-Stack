# Enterprise-SIEM-Dashboard-with-ELK-Stack
This project involves building a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using the open-source Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch for storage/search, Logstash for ingestion/processing, Kibana for visualization/dashboards, and often Beats/Elastic Agents for collection).
